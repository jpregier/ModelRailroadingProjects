The two arduino sketches contained in this directory will operate four LEDs in a stratolite beacon on your model railroad locomotives.
arduinoMillisStratolite.ino is an arduino sequence.  Used with a properly configured breadboard, it will operate four LEDs in repetitive sequence.
attiny13aStratoliteSequence.ino is another arduino sequence, though it is also compatible with the Attiny13a microcontroller.
